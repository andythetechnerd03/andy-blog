## Work Experience
### AI Engineer @ FPT Software AI Center | _August 2024 - Present_
- Built a system for Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) verification using agent system.
- Still working... (will update soon)

### Data Engineer @ FPT Software | _November 2023 - August 2024_
- Built data pipeline for a large-scale data processing system, complex visualization and predictive modeling (raw data approximately > 10GB).
- Learned a powerful low-code Data Science platform, which helped the team automate the data pipeline flow and reduce the time to finalize the project.
- Cut down data processing time by 50% by optimizing the data type, asynchronous programming, and accelerated hardware.
- Prepared question-answer data pairs and fine-tuned a Large Multimodal Model on face description system.
- Addressed chatbot limitations such as topic drift and datetime reasoning using clustering and function calling.

### AI Intern @ Quy Nhon AI Center | _September 2023 - December 2023_
- Trained and evaluated a table recognition model on synthetically generated data.
- Developed and published a Python package for table recognition and data synthesis tool.
- Handled and peer-reviewed 100+ OCR and KIE image labeling images per day (as part of ML project).
- Turned model into a containerized REST API for easy deployment.

## Projects
### KAN It Play Flappy Bird | _May 2024 - August 2024_
- Built a Flappy Bird game-playing AI using Reinforcement Learning, but replaces traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
- Achieved a equivalent high score with MLP despite the same number of parameters.
- Sucessfully merged with the AwesomeKAN repository to showcase awesome KAN projects.

### Soccer Match Outcome Prediction | _May 2024 - August 2024_
- Performed complex feature engineering using spatial and temporal data.
- Developed a model to predict the probability of goal event using 2018-19 Top 5 European Leagues data.
- Achieved ~ 90% accuracy in predicting the match outcome, with a comprehensive experiment of Machine Learning / Deep Learning models.

### Vietnamese Text Summarization in Poem Format | _January 2024 - April 2024_
- Developed and fine-tuned a Vistral-7B model for Vietnamese text summarization in five-word poem.
- Utilized prompt engineering to tell a story using pre-existing Vietnamese poems to be used as training and testing data.
- Optimized training time by seven-fold using various LLM fine-tuning techniques, such as FlashAttention and QLoRA.
- Further cut down inference time by 10x using C++ conversion and GGUF quantization.

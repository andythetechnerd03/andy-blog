- Successfully completed a 3-month intensive Full-Stack AI Bootcamp through various exercises and final project.
- Exercises include:
    - Model Compression using Quantization and Pruning. Achieved a 40% smaller model while only sacrificing less than 5% reduction of accuracy on CIFAR-100 Dataset. [code](https://github.com/andythetechnerd03/Compressing-GoogleNet)
    - Building a Basic Calculator web application using React and Bootstrap. [code](https://github.com/andythetechnerd03/simple-calculator-app)
    - Continuous Integration / Delivery with GitHub / GitHub Action.
    - DataOps with Data Version Control - DVC.
    - NLP - BERT model fine-tuning.
- **Final Project**: Deployment of [3D Body Pose Estimation and Motion Capture](https://github.com/facebookresearch/frankmocap) on a cloud-based web application. [code](https://github.com/vhbaoduy/motion_capture).

### YouTuber @ DNATech | _2013 - 2023_
- Created and edited videos on technology, smartphones, and shared hacking tutorials.
- In 2023, the channel also served as a platform for teaching Mathematics for Machine Learning to FPT University students. [Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvt7Q4KDA-3wpG5Q__9QrjykAFx_m_jGE&si=Qw8JivWoqAA48T48)
- Reached 1.9K subscribers and over 100k views.
